# About this Repository

I started off simply taking notes on the [TensorFlow white paper](http://download.tensorflow.org/paper/whitepaper2015.pdf), but as I worked I started putting more and more time into finding/linking to reference material in the TensorFlow documentation and resources. Additionally, I attempted to increase my understanding of the paper by re-phrasing certain sections as well as translating some of the algorithms from paragraph-form to ordered lists.

Reading the white paper has improved my comfort with the APIs dramatically, and I hope that others will benefit from my notes.
